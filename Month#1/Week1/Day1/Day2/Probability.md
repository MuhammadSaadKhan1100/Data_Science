# Probability: ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘½
Measure of likely hood of an event.
# Example:
Tossing a coin
S = {H, T }
Probability = # of ways an event occurs/ # of possible outcomes
P(H) = Â½
P(T) = Â½

# Rolling a dice: 
P(1) = 1/6
P(2) = 1/6
P(3) = 1/6
P(4) = 1/6
P(5) = 1/6
P(6) = 1/6
# Difference between Mutually Exclusive Event and Not Mutually Exclusive Event: ðŸŽ‡

Additive rule of Mutually Exclusive (ME) and Non-Mutually Exclusive (NME) Events:
ME = P( A OR B ) = P(A) + P(B)
NME = P( A OR B ) = P(A) + P(B) â€“ P( A ^  B)
Additive rule Examples of Mutually Exclusive Events:
Taking a coin
P(H OR T) = P(H) + P(T)
= Â½ + Â½
= 1
# Additive rule Examples of Non-Mutually Exclusive Events:
Taking out a card from deck
P (K or heart)  =  ?
P(K) = 4/52
P(heart) = 13/52
P(K ^ heart) = 1/52
P(K or heart) = 4/52 + 13/52 â€“ 1/52
= 16/52
# Independent event	and Dependent event
