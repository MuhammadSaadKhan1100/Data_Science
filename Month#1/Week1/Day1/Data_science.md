# What is Data Science:ðŸ˜®
Data Science refers to 
 . Better decision making
 . Predictive Analysis
 . Pattern Discovery
# Example:
If we were to buy a furniture, we will decide which website to use

# Applications of Data Science:ðŸš—ðŸš˜
. Self Driving Cars:
Available functions:
1.	Speed up
2.	Slow down
3.	Left
4.	Right
# Description:
Self driving cars are provided with certain images and best possible routes. Research says it can even minimize accidents and around 2 million deaths could be reduced.
. Airlines:
With the use of data science pain of passengers and airlines could be reduced since classes of planes can be selected.
. Shipping:
Data science involves route planning through which shipping time can be predicted earlier. Traffic can also be predicted like e.g in Google Maps Traffic is predicted for different routes.
. Promotional Offers:
Ever wondered searching in websites for utilities and the next day itâ€™s on your social media, all thanks to Data Science.
# What Data Science answers?
. Rating/TRP of the shows
. Which route should my cab take to reach faster, the same program is used in Uber, Careem and Indriver
.Will refrigerator fail in 3 years
. Who will win the elections
# Steps of Data Science:
. Asking the right question
. Modeling data then exploratory analysis
. Decide which algorithm or Model to use
. Final Communication
. Visualizing Results

# Difference between Business Intelligence and Data Science:
Criteria	Business Intelligence	Data Science
Data Source	Structured data 
Working of MS SQL
Reports and Dashboard	Unstructured data
e.g web logs, comments, customer feedback
         Method	Analytic
Just trying to present historical data	Scientific
In terms of deeper findings and statistical 
analysis
           Skills	Statistics, Visualization and only consists of dashboards	Statistics, Visualization and Machine learning much more involved
           Focus	Pretty much historical and past data	Present data and Future prediction

# Prerequisites/Essentials of Data Science:
# 3 Cs of Data Science
       
1.	Curiosity
Ask right questions for problems.
2.	Common sense
Be Creative
3.	Communication skills.
  Need to communicate with Business teams and parties inorder to act upon insights
Other Pre-requisites:
	Machine learning:
Backbone of data science
Used to find solutions to problems
	Mathematical models:
Can be extremely helpful to make calculations and predictions from the given data
#	Statistics:
Foundational to extract knowledge and obtain better results from the data
Computer Programming:
Python
R
# Database:
Teaches to ask better questions as a data scientist.

# Machine learning Algorithms as a data scientist

1.	Regression (Predicting temperature or share price)
2.	Clustering (Shaping)
3.	Decision Tree (Logical way of arranging)
4.	Support Vector Machine (Classification purpose)
5.	NaÃ¯ve Baiyes (Probability based classification method)

# Lifecycle of data science project:
1.	 Concept study
. Get understanding of business model
. Ask questions
. Meet stake holders
e.g predict price of 1.35 karat diamond
	2. Data Preparation/Data Merging
Most important aspect of data science. Since data can be coming from Different sources so errors can occurs. There are certain techniques inorder to reduce such errors
Data integration
Data transformation (Normalize transformation)
Data reduction (Reducing size of data)
Data cleaning (Correcting inconsistent data by filling out missing values)
Make the data clean and valuable
# Ways to fill missing data values:
1.	If the data is huge, we can simply remove the rows with missing data values. We use rest of the data to predict values
2.	We can substitute missing values with mean of the rest of the data using Pandaâ€™s data frame in python
3.	Split the data into Train data and test data with usually of the ratio 80:20

# Model Planning:
What kind of model we are going to pick and train that particular model.
What is exploratory data analysis:
# Initial preparatory step to check if data is accurate
. Find out data types
. Check if data is clean
. Identify outliers
. Identify patterns
# Train data vs Test data:
1.	Train data is used to develop model
2.	Test data is used to validate model

# Industries with high demand of data scientists:
1.	Technology (IT sector, Engineering, Globally)
2.	Marketing
3.	Finance (Banks and Insurance companies)
4.	Healthcare (Used for predicting disease and diagnosing that disease)
5.	Gaming
