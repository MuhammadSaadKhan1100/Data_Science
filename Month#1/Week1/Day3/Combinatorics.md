 # Combinatorics: 👨‍⚖️👩‍👩‍👧👨‍👩‍👧‍👧👨‍👨‍👦👨‍👨‍👧
It is a rich field of Mathematics from classic Enumerative ones to analysis.
# Two major Problems: 😫
1.	Graph Theory
2.	Famous splitting necklace problem

We will be discussing enumerative part which is synonymous with systematic counting

3️⃣
# Principles of Enumerative part 

1.	Addition
2.	Multiplication
3.	Inclusion-Exclusion

# Example:
In a bank, people are queuing up either to deposit money or borrow money. What we need to do is to arrange the customers accordingly so that if bank runs out of cash, the next line will not be borrowing or bank won’t run out of cash.
The next thing is in how many ways they can be arranged in a queue.
# Balance:
$(AB+E-CD)>= $0
AB = Amount gained
CD = Amount lost
E = Bank cash

Worth trying -> A = C
		       B = D
		       E = 0
